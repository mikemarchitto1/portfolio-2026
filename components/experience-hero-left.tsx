        I’m originally from Chicago, where I studied graphic design at UIC—a
        program rooted in Swiss and International design principles. That
        foundation shaped my early work in marketing and communications, where I
        developed a strong sense of visual design and storytelling. I’ve always
        been drawn to typography, simple communication, and design that feels
        useful.

        After relocating to Seattle, I moved into UX, drawn to digital design
        and the need for better product experiences. Over the years, I’ve worked
        across corporations, agencies, and startups—advocating for user‑centered
        design. I'm recently exploring how AI is reshaping creative work through
        automation, prototyping, and collaboration.

        Currently based in Miami, I’m a cyclist and outdoors enthusiast who
        finds peace on the trail. Time outside helps reset and balance my life.
        Whether riding through city streets or remote gravel paths, I’m always
        looking for great scenic routes to the next bike camping destination.
